### INTRODUCTION
Plantera reminds you to water your houseplants everytime you are busy. It's your own personal assistant to help you love & care for plants more easily. If you often forget to water your most favorite plants &amp; flowers at home or office this app is one specially designed for you with love. This app will track all your plants and notify you when attention is needed. So never let your flowers wither again. Users have multiple plants and each plant has different care requirements and that could be really difficult to keep tabs on, also having busy schedules sometimes lead to forgetting to water the plants. Plantera offers a multi-theme where users can modify each plant to its own color palette.
